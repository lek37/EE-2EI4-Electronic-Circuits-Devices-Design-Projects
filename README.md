# Welcome to my EE 2EI4 Project Repo!

## Disclaimer:
- Welcome to my 2EI4 Project page! Under this repositories you will find my project deliverables here. You are welcome to use this as a reference, but for your learning, please do not copy and paste everything into your report.
- For project 2 I didn't have time to do it properly since I was having 3 midterms squeezed in between with the due date. Consult other sources if possible. 
- **Project 3: Voltage Amplifiers** deliverable can be found in this video recording as my preferred submission: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4y-tnzBNro. You can also write a report as an alternative way of submission as well.

## For LaTeX users (Overleaf)
If you use LaTeX to write your report (Overleaf), and you wish to use my formatting for your report, you can do the following: 
1. Copy and paste the following and put appropriate information (semester, date, your name, MacID, student number, project name,...). Do NOT click `Compile` yet, because you will have to set up the appropriate compiler for Times New Roman font.
